## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

## BASIC CALCULATOR
## OBJECTIVE
The Basic Calculator program is a simple Python application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. Here's a summary of its structure and functionality:

### Key Features:
Arithmetic Operations:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
User Input:

Accepts two numeric inputs from the user.
Prompts the user to select an operation using symbols (+, -, *, /).
## Error Handling:

Handles non-numeric inputs and provides appropriate error messages.
Prevents division by zero by displaying an error message if the denominator is zero.
## Output:
Welcome to the Basic Calculator!

Enter the first number:  4
Enter the second number:  7
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /):  +
The result of 4.0 + 7.0 is: 11.0

Displays the result of the selected operation in a user-friendly format.
### How It Works:
##Input Validation:

The program ensures that inputs are valid numbers.
Prompts the user to re-enter inputs if invalid data is detected.
## Operation Selection:

Users can choose operations by typing the corresponding symbols.
If an unsupported operation is entered, the program notifies the user.
## Result Display:

After performing the selected operation, the program outputs the result.
Results are formatted clearly, showing the calculation performed.
